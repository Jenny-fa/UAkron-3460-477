# Homework 2: prime-numbers

## Building

This project is configured using [CMake](https://cmake.org) version 3.0 or
later, and requires a C++11 compiler.

The default build target creates an executable named `prime-numbers`.

## Usage

The `prime-numbers` program takes two command-line arguments: the number of
primes to generate, and the number of threads to use. Both arguments must be
non-negative integers.

An example that outputs 1000 primes and runs two tasks in parallel:

```shell
./prime-numbers 1000 2
```

## Known Bugs

Due to integer overflow during modular exponentiation, there is an effective
upper bound on the number of primes that can be generated by the program. For
example, `./prime-numbers 1000000 2` will only output approximately 196544
primes on 64-bit Cygwin.
